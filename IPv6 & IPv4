✅ Difference Between IPv4 and IPv6
Feature                | IPv4                                      | IPv6
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Address Size           | 32-bit (4 bytes)                          | 128-bit (16 bytes)
Address Format         | Decimal, dotted notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1) | Hexadecimal, colon-separated (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334)
Total Addresses        | ~4.3 billion (2^32)                       | ~340 undecillion (2^128)
Header Complexity      | Simple, 12 fields                         | More complex, optimized for routing
Security               | Optional (IPSec)                          | Mandatory (IPSec built-in)
Configuration          | Manual or DHCP                            | Auto-configuration supported
Broadcast              | Supported                                  | No broadcast (uses multicast)
Fragmentation          | Done by sender & routers                  | Done only by sender


✅ Example IPv4 Address:
192.168.1.10
✅ Example IPv6 Address:
2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

✅ Example of IPv4 Address
192.168.1.10


Binary: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010
CIDR: /24 means subnet mask 255.255.255.0.

✅ Example of IPv6 Address
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334


Can be shortened:

2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334


Hexadecimal representation makes it compact.


✅ Why IPv6 is Better than IPv4

Address Space

IPv4: 4.3 billion addresses → exhausted due to internet growth.
IPv6: 340 undecillion addresses → practically unlimited.


Performance

Simplified header for faster routing.


Security

IPSec is mandatory in IPv6.


Auto-configuration

Devices can configure themselves without DHCP.


No NAT needed

Every device can have a unique global IP.


Better multicast support

Efficient for streaming and group communication.




✅ How IP Addresses Are Calculated
IPv4 Calculation

IPv4 = 32 bits → 2³² = 4,294,967,296 addresses.
Example:

Network: 192.168.1.0/24
/24 means first 24 bits are network, last 8 bits for hosts.
Hosts = 2⁸ - 2 = 254 usable IPs (subtract network & broadcast).



IPv6 Calculation

IPv6 = 128 bits → 2¹²⁸ ≈ 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses.
Example:

Network: 2001:db8::/64
/64 means first 64 bits are network, last 64 bits for hosts.
Hosts = 2⁶⁴ ≈ 18 quintillion addresses per subnet!




✅ Interview Tips
Common questions:

Why do we need IPv6?
Explain IPv4 vs IPv6 differences.
How many IPs in /24 subnet?
How does IPv6 handle auto-configuration?
Does IPv6 use NAT? Why or why not?
