✅ What is CIDR? (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing that replaces the old "classful" system (Class A, B, C).

Instead of fixed classes, CIDR uses a flexible notation:
IP address + slash + number of network bits.

Example:
192.168.1.0/24
- "192.168.1.0" is the network address.
- "/24" means the first 24 bits are the network portion.


✅ Why CIDR is Important
- Efficient use of IP addresses.
- Allows subnetting (breaking networks into smaller networks).
- Used in AWS VPC, Kubernetes clusters, and routing tables.


✅ CIDR Notation Explained
CIDR notation: IP address / prefix length
Prefix length = number of bits for the network portion.

Example:
10.0.0.0/16
- Network bits: 16
- Host bits: 32 - 16 = 16
- Total IPs: 2^16 = 65,536 addresses


✅ Subnetting Explained
Subnetting = dividing a large network into smaller sub-networks.

Example:
Network: 192.168.1.0/24
- /24 means 256 IP addresses (2^8).
- Usable IPs: 256 - 2 = 254 (subtract network & broadcast).

If we subnet /24 into /26:
- /26 means 64 IP addresses per subnet (2^6).
- Usable IPs per subnet: 62.
- Number of subnets: 4 (because 256 / 64 = 4).


✅ Relation Between CIDR and Subnetting
- CIDR defines the network size using prefix length.
- Subnetting uses CIDR to break networks into smaller chunks.


✅ IPv4 and IPv6 with CIDR & Subnetting
IPv4:
- 32-bit address space.
- CIDR ranges: /0 to /32.
- Example: 192.168.0.0/24 (256 IPs).

IPv6:
- 128-bit address space.
- CIDR ranges: /0 to /128.
- Example: 2001:db8::/64 (18 quintillion IPs per subnet).
- IPv6 subnetting is simpler because /64 is standard for hosts.


✅ How to Calculate Subnets
Formula:
Number of IPs = 2^(Host bits)
Host bits = Total bits - Network bits

Example:
Network: 10.0.0.0/20
- Network bits: 20
- Host bits: 32 - 20 = 12
- IPs: 2^12 = 4096
- Usable IPs: 4094


✅ Common CIDR Blocks
/8   = 16,777,216 IPs
/16  = 65,536 IPs
/24  = 256 IPs
/32  = 1 IP (host)
